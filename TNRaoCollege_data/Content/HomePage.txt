	that makes the life of a person who will live not only for him, but for the society. We, at T.N.Rao College managed by Savyasachi 
	Education trust, work for the betterment of the society. Savyasachi is the name of Arjun. We wish our students to be as focused as 
	Arjun in their studies. All who step and become a part of our family are lifelong members of our family. They come, learn, grow and 
	enlighten themselves with great values. At the end of the academic journey they become the part of the society and work for the 
	progress of nation at large. There are many students spread all over world with the name of T.N.Rao College in their mark sheets.

	green campus make the students fresh when they are with us. We have tried our best to provide best laboratory and library facility
